        <h1>Paris</h1>
        <p>Paris is unarguably one of the most beautiful cities in the world, the capital of France,
            of art and of fashion.There are a thousand things to do and see in Paris and however 
            much time you have here, it won’t be enough.Climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower, 
            stroll down the Champs Elysées, visit the Louvre, see many shows and exhibitions, 
            or simply wander along the banks of the Seine...read in French in the Tuileries garden, 
            and quite simply take the time to experience the Parisian way of life.
            Stepping into this whirlwind that takes you from frenzy to romanticism will leave you 
            with enduring memories.For centuries Paris has been one of the world’s most important 
            and attractive cities. It is appreciated for the opportunities it offers for business 
            and commerce, for study, for culture, and for entertainment; its gastronomy, haute 
            couture, painting, literature, and intellectual community especially enjoy an enviable 
            reputation. Its sobriquet “the City of Light” (“la Ville Lumière”), earned during the 
            Enlightenment, remains appropriate, for Paris has retained its importance as a centre 
            for education and intellectual pursuits.
