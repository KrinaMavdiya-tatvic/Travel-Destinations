        <h1>New York</h1>
        <p>New York is the most ethnically diverse, religiously varied, commercially driven, 
            famously congested, and, in the eyes of many, the most attractive urban centre in the 
            country. No other city has contributed more images to the collective consciousness of 
            Americans: Wall Street means finance, Broadway is synonymous with theatre, Fifth Avenue
             is automatically paired with shopping, Madison Avenue means the advertising industry, 
             Greenwich Village connotes bohemian lifestyles, Seventh Avenue signifies fashion, 
             Tammany Hall defines machine politics, and Harlem evokes images of the Jazz Age, 
             African American aspirations, and slums. The word tenement brings to mind both the miseries
              of urban life and the upward mobility of striving immigrant masses. New York has more Jews 
              than Tel Aviv, more Irish than Dublin, more Italians than Naples, and more Puerto Ricans than 
              San Juan. Its symbol is the Statue of Liberty, but the metropolis is itself an icon, the arena 
              in which Emma Lazarus’s “tempest-tost” people of every nation are transformed into 
              Americans—and if they remain in the city, they become New Yorkers.
