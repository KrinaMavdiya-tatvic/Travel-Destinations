        <h1>Singapore</h1>
        <p>Singapore is a sunny, tropical island in Southeast Asia, off the southern tip of the 
            Malay Peninsula. Singapore is a city, a nation and a state. It is about 275 square 
            miles, smaller than the State of Rhode Island, and inhabited by five million people 
            from four major communities; Chinese (majority), Malay, Indian and Eurasian. Since its 
            independence in 9 August 1965, the country has adopted a parliamentary democracy system.
             Currently, the government and the cabinet are led by Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong while 
             President Halimah Yacob is the Head of State.
            Singapore is known as a City in a Garden and nearly 50 percent of the island is green 
            space. It is a thriving metropolis offering a world-class infrastructure, a fully 
            integrated island-wide transportnetwork, dynamic business environment, vibrant living 
            spaces and a rich culture largely influenced by the four major communities in Singapore
             with each offering different perspective of life in Singapore in terms of culture, 
             religion, food, language and history.
